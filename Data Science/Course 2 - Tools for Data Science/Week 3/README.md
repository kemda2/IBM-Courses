# Open Source Tools for Data Science
# Week 3

### Watson Studio

- Watson Studio is an integrated platform of tools services and data that helps companies accelerate their shift to become data-driven organizations.
- Using Watson Studio we can simplify data projects with a streamlined process, that allows to extract value and insights from data to help business get smarter, faster.
- It delivers an easy-to-use collaborative data science and machine learning environment for building and training models, preparing and analyzing data, and sharing insights, all in one place.
- Watson's Studio can help to get started with modeling templates for areas such as visual recognition, language classification, and other tools from IBM Watson services. 
- Because Watson Studio is seamlessly integrated with the IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog, an intelligent asset discovery tool, we can transform data and models into trusted enterprise resources and collaborate with confidence, without compromising compliance, security or access control. 
- Watson Studio provides many benefits for organizations helping to infuse AI into the business and drive innovation.
- We can train Watson studio with embedded AI services including watson visual recognition.
- We can customize our models and deploy them as APIs or Core ML by using open source tools like Jupyter, Notebook, Anaconda and RStudio.
- Watson Studio supports most popular code libraries as well as no code visual modeling with neural network modeler for designing neural architectures using the most popular deep learning frameworks.
- In Watson Studio we can interactively discover, cleanse, and transform data using data refinery. It helps understand the quality and distribution of data with built-in charts and statistics, and provides visualized results through interactive dashboards.
- Watson Studio includes an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that enables a non programmer to speed up the bottle building process by visually selecting, configuring, designing and auto coding neural networks.
- From development and training to production and evaluation, Watson Studio tracks our models over time to ensure we have the best performance for any given task using the best solutions across the entire lifecycle of our machine learning models.

### Jupyter Notebook in Watson Studio

Please click the "Jupyter Notebook" to know how to setup Jupyter Notebook in Watson Studio. It is easy and simple.

### Watson Knowledge Catalog

- Watson Knowledge Catalog corresponds to the Data Asset Management, Code Asset Management, Data Management, and Data Integration and Transformation. 
- Watson Knowledge Catalog is a data catalog that is integrated with an enterprise data governance platform. 
- It also merges the analytics capabilities of Watson Studio. 
- The data catalog assists data scientists to easily find, prepare, understand, and use the data as needed. Watson Knowledge Catalog protects data from misuse and enables the sharing of assets with automated, dynamic masking of sensitive data elements. 
-  IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog has various deployment choices on IBM Cloud™ and can be run anywhere with IBM Cloud Pak™ for Data.
- Watson Knowledge Catalog includes capabilities to automatically mask sensitive data according to our organization's governance policies.

### Data Refinery

- IBM Data Refinery addresses this issue and simplifies the task of refining data and its workflows.
- It provides a self-service data preparation environment where we can quickly analyze, cleanse and prepare data sets.
- Data refinery is available with Watson Studio on public cloud, private cloud and desktop.

### SPSS Modeler Flows

- SPSS Modeler Flows is a part of Watson Studio, which was inspired by another product, IBM SPSS Modeler.
- Modeler flows include some data management capabilities, as well as tools for data preparation, visualization, and model building. 
- All flows are created using a drag-and-drop editor and consist of “nodes” of various types, with data “flowing” from one node to the next according to their connections

Please click the "Modeler Flows in IBM Watson Studio" to experiment on Modeler Flows in Watson Studio.

### IBM SPSS Modeler

-  IBM spss modeler includes data management capabilities and tools for data preparation visualization model building and model deployment.
- The product was created by integral Solutions Limited in the United Kingdom in 1994 and was originally called Clementine.
- SPSS modeler is a data mining and text analytics software application.
- It is used to build predictive models and conduct other analytics tasks.
- It has a visual interface that enables users to leverage statistical and data mining algorithms without programming.
- IBM SPSS modeler offers a rich modeling palette that includes many classification regression clustering

### IBM SPSS Statistics

- It is a statistical and machine learning software application and is widely used in academia, government agencies, and large enterprises. 
- It’s used to build predictive models, perform statistical analysis of data, and conduct other analytic tasks. 
- It has a visual interface, which enables users to leverage statistical and data mining algorithms without programming, although the interface is very different from Modeler.
- IBM SPSS Statistics helps data scientists to analyze their data using many statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Using a graphical user interface, we can create complicated analysis that can be saved in the form of syntax and reused later.

### Model Deployment with Watson Machine Learning

- Watson Machine Learning is IBM’s commercial offering designed for model deployment.
- It supports deployment of models built with most open source packages, as well as those expressed in PMML or ONNX. - It also supports deployment of IBM SPSS Modeler streams and Modeler flows from Watson Studio.
- Deployment can be done using a graphical interface or Python code, and can be for online scoring through a REST API or batch scoring.
- Watson Machine Learning helps integrate a deployed model into applications in the form of code snippets in several programming languages.

### Auto AI in Watson Studio

- The AutoAI system was developed by IBM Research experts in collaboration with IBM Distinguished Engineer and two-time Kaggle Grandmaster Jean-Francois Puget.
- It provides a graphical interface to create and deploy machine learning models with real time visualizations.
- AutoAI automatically performs typical machine learning steps, such as: Data preparation Model selection Feature engineering Hyper-parameter optimization Users can view the progress on the graphical interface.

### IBM Watson OpenScale

- Features of Watson Studio that help to ensure fairness and explainability of machine learning pipelines, as well as moniter their performance after deployment.
- It can test the model and its predictions for fairness and apply ways to overcome bias.
- It monitors the model performance and can detect its deteriorations or "model drift", and explain which predictors are causing it.
