## IBM- Data Science

### [Databases and SQL for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science/home/welcome)    
The purpose of this course is to introduce relational database concepts and help to learn and apply foundational knowledge of the SQL language. It is also intended to get started with performing SQL access in a data science environment.  

The emphasis in this course is on hands-on and practical learning . As such, I worked with real databases, real data science tools, and real-world datasets. I created a database instance in the cloud. Through a series of hands-on labs, I did practice building and running SQL queries. I understood how to access databases from Jupyter notebooks using SQL and Python.

### [Week 1](https://github.com/kk289/IBM-Data-Science/tree/master/Course%205_Databases%20and%20SQL%20for%20Data%20Science/Week%201)        
#### Introduction to Databases and Basic SQL    
Introduced to databases. Created a database instance on the cloud. Learned some of the basic SQL statements. Also wrote and understood basic SQL hands-on on a live database.

##### Key Concepts:   
- Explain SQL and Relational Databases
- Create a database instance on the Cloud
- Learn how to write basic SQL statements
- Practice basic SQL statements hands-on on a live database

### [Week 2](./Week%202)    
#### Advanced SQL   
In this module, I learned:     
- how to use string patterns and ranges to search data
- how to sort and group data in result sets.
- how to work with multiple tables in a relational database using join operations.   

##### Key Concepts      
- Explain how to use string patterns and ranges in SQL queries
- Demonstrate how to sort and order result sets
- Practice use of grouping data in result sets
- Employ Built-in functions in Queries
- Demonstrate how to write sub-queries and nested selects
- Build queries to access multiple tables

### [Week 3](./Week%203)   
#### Accessing Databases using Python
In this module, I learned how to explain the basic concepts related to using Python to connect to databases and then create tables, load data, query data using SQL, and analyze data using Python.

##### Key Concepts    
- Describe concepts related to accessing Databases using Python
- Learn and Practice how to connect to a database from a Jupyter notebook
- Understand and demonstrate how to create tables and insert data from Python
- Write SQL queries and retrieve result sets from Python
- Practice how to perform simplified database access from Python using SQL magic
- Enumerate different type of JOIN operations
- Explain what is an INNER JOIN and practice hands-on
- Distinguish between different types of OUTER JOINs and apply your understanding

### [Week 4](./Week%204)   
#### Working with real-world data sets and built-in SQL functions
I would be working with multiple real world datasets for the city of Chicago. Through project it helped me understand the data just like a data scientist would.

##### Key Concepts
- Demonstrate effective use of formulating SQL queries
- Demonstrate use of invoking SQL queries from Jupyter notebooks using Python
- Demonstrate skill in retrieving SQL query results and analyzing data
