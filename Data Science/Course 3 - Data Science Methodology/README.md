## IBM- Data Science

### [Data Science Methodology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-methodology/home/info)   

This course has one purpose, and that is to share a methodology that can be used within data science, to ensure that the data used in problem solving is relevant and properly manipulated to address the question at hand.

What I learned:   
- The major steps involved in tackling a data science problem.
- The major steps involved in practicing data science, from forming a concrete business or research problem, to collecting and analyzing data, to building a model, and understanding the feedback after model deployment.
- How data scientists think!

### [Week 1](https://github.com/kk289/IBM-Data-Science/tree/master/Course%203_Data%20Science%20Methodology/Week%201)        
#### From Problem to Approach and from Requirements to Collection   
In this module, I learned about why we are interested in data science, what a methodology is, and why data scientists need a methodology. Learned about the data science methodology and its flowchart. Learned about the first two stages of the data science methodology, namely Business Understanding and Analytic Approach. Finally, through a lab session, I understood how to complete the Business Understanding and the Analytic Approach stages and the Data Requirements and Data Collection stages pertaining to any data science problem.    

##### Key Concepts:   
- Learn about why we are interested in data science.
- Learn what a methodology is, and why data scientists need a methodology.
- Learn about the data science methodology and its flowchart.
- Learn about the Business Understaning, the Analytic Approach, the Data Requirements, and the Data Understanding stages of the data science methodology.
- Learn about what occurs during data collection.
- Learn how to complete the Business Understanding and the Analytic Approach stages pertaining to any data science problem.
- Learn how to complete the Data Requirements and the Data Collection stages pertaining to any data science problem.    


### [Week 2](./Week%202)    
#### From Understanding to Preparation and From Modeling to Evaluation
In this module, I learned what it means to understand data, and prepare or clean data. Learned about the purpose of data modeling and some characteristics of the modeling process. Finally, through a lab session, I understood how to complete the Data Understanding and the Data Preparation stages, as well as the Modeling and the Model Evaluation stages pertaining to any data science problem.   

##### Key Concepts
- Learn what it means to understand data.
- Learn what it means to prepare or clean data.
- Learn about ways in which data is prepared.
- Learn what the purpose of data modeling is.
- Learn about some characteristics of the modeling process.
- Learn about what it means to evaluate a model and ways in which a model is evaluated.
- Learn how to complete the Data Understanding and the Data Preparation stages pertaining to any data science problem.
- Learn how to complete the Modeling and the Model Evaluation stages pertaining to any data science problem.

### [Week 3](./Week%203)   
#### From Deployment to Feedback
In this module, I learned about what happens when a model is deployed and why model feedback is important. Also, by completing a peer-reviewed assignment, I demonstrated my understanding of the data science methodology by applying it to a problem that you define.

##### Key Concepts
- Learn about what happens when a model is deployed.
- Learn about why model feedback is important.
- Demonstrate understanding of the data science methodology by applying it to a problem that I define.
