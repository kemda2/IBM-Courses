## IBM- Data Science

### [Tools for Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/open-source-tools-for-data-science/home/welcome)   

In this course, I learned about Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio IDE, Apache Zeppelin and Data Science Experience. Learned about what each tool is used for, what programming languages they can execute, their features and limitations. With the tools hosted in the cloud on Cognitive Class Labs, I am able to test each tool and follow instructions to run simple code in Python, R or Scala.

To end the course, I created a final project with a Jupyter Notebook on IBM Data Science Experience and demonstrate my proficiency preparing a notebook, writing Markdown, and sharing work with other peers.
