### Final Assignment:   
In this Assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of the data science methodology by applying it to a given problem. Pick one of the following topics to apply the data science methodology to:

- Emails
- Hospitals
- Credit Cards

You will have to play the role of the client as well as the data scientist to come up with a problem that is more specific but related to these topics.

##### Project Title:    
Analyzing Credit Cards Default

##### Which topic did you choose to apply the data science methodology to?   
My Answer: I chose Credit Cards to apply the data science methodology. Since I have already done similar kind of project during college, I think it would be better to do this again to understand more effectively. 

##### Using the topic that you selected, complete the Business Understanding stage by coming up with a problem that you would like to solve and phrasing it in the form of a question that you will use data to answer.

You are required to:

- Describe the problem, related to the topic you selected.
- Phrase the problem as a question to be answered using data.

My Answer: Many banks and credit card companies have a high risk in that their clients will default on their credit card payment or not. Especially, banks want to reduce this risk by building a model that utilizes features that they have in their database about each individual. 

So the question for this project would be, "Can we predict whether a customer or client will default on their payment based on given features?"

##### Briefly explain how you would complete each of the following stages for the problem that you described in the Business Understanding stage, so that you are ultimately able to answer the question that you came up with.:

- Analytic Approach
- Data Requirements
- Data Collection
- Data Understanding and Preparation
- Modeling and Evaluation

My Answer:    
1. Analytic Approach: The problem requires a YES/NO answer so we will use a classification model.    

2. Data Requirements: To create a classification model, we will need features regarding bank clients. The features include client amount of credit limit approved, client gender, education, marriage status, age, bill statements of within 5 months, payment transactions within 5 months.   

3. Data Collection: We use descriptive statistics and data evaluation techniques to make sure that we have the correct information for our predictive model.   

4. Data Understanding and Preparation: Here, we need to take care of our features/variables. Are there any correlations between any features. We calculate the mean/median, stand deviations, univariate statistics. Those steps need to carry out for data understanding. Since data preparations took almost 90% time of the whole project, we look for missing data, visualize features, and transform data to better fit our model.   

5. Modeling and Evaluation: We would create a classification model and evaluate the outcome result. We may need to make some changes to get a suitable model that could help predict a credit default.
