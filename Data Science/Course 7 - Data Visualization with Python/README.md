## IBM- Data Science

### [Data Visualization with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-visualization-with-python/home/welcome)    
Data visualization plays an essential role in the representation of both small and large-scale data. This course taught how to take data that at first glance has little meaning and present that data in a form that makes sense to people. Various techniques have been developed for presenting data visually but in this course, I used several data visualization libraries in Python, namely Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.    



Topics covered:

1) Introduction to Data Visualization Tools   
2) Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools
3) Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data    
 


### [Week 1](https://github.com/kk289/IBM-Data-Science/tree/master/Course%207_Data%20Visualization%20with%20Python/Week%201)        
#### Introduction to Data Visualization Tools   
In this module, I learned about data visualization and some of the best practices to keep in mind when creating plots and visuals. Learned about the history and the architecture of Matplotlib and learn about basic plotting with Matplotlib. In addition, Learned about the dataset on immigration to Canada, which will be used extensively throughout the course. Finally, briefly learned how to read csv files into a pandas dataframe and process and manipulate the data in the dataframe, and how to generate line plots using Matplotlib.

### [Week 3](./Week%203)   
####  Advanced Visualizations and Geospatial Data   
In this module, I learned about advanced visualization tools such as waffle charts and word clouds and how to create them. Learned about seaborn, which is another visualization library, and how to use it to generate attractive regression plots. In addition, Learned about Folium, which is another visualization library, designed especially for visualizing geospatial data. Finally, Learned how to use Folium to create maps of different regions of the world and how to superimpose markers on top of a map, and how to create choropleth maps.


##### Topic:    
- Waffle Charts
